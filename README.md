# MDTools

Scripts using MDAnalysis and MDTraj to analyze MD simulations.

1. dssp_rg_and_ree_mdtraj.py has the code to calculate secondary structure, radius of gyration, and end-to-end-distance, as well as other biophysical metrics (meant to be run in interactive python env).
2. contact_prob_PDF.py has the code to calculate a probability density function of ligand-protein binding on an amino-acid level using the COM of the ligand and the COM of each residue on the protein.
3. plotter_dssp_and_contacts.py plots and formats the outputs of the above scripts (1 and 2). Data is loaded from a compressed "pickle" format. Plots can be customized for different proteins. 
4. Mdtraj_helper.py has support functions for platting and calculating DSSP
